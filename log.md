# 100 Days Of Code - Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 1, Friday, 2020].

### Day 0: May 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Create local and remote github repos for my 100DaysOfCode challenge.
2. connect to UO shell and get ready for building a personal portfolio webpage.

**Thoughts:** I'm picking up what I learned in 111, 282 and 382. In the meantime build my own projects (later I will try freecodecamp's projects suggested by Kallaway)

### Day 2: May 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Start the Roll Dice App: set up the dice roll page.
2. re-learn html DOM: with the html DOM, JS can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

**Thoughts** I realized I forgot a lot of what I learned about JS and HTML. But after re-learning them, I feel I have a much better understanding of the materials and they now stick to my mind more rigorously. :)

### Day 3: May 3, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Use javascript instead of HTML to add elements (such as text node, images, input box, and buttons) to the browser.
2. Add onclick attribute for buttons
3. Take the value from input box as parameter in Function.
