# 100 Days Of Code - Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 1, Friday, 2020].

### Day 1: May 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Create local and remote github repos for my 100DaysOfCode challenge.
2. connect to UO shell and get ready for building a personal portfolio webpage.

**Thoughts:** I'm picking up what I learned in 111, 282 and 382. In the meantime build my own projects (later I will try freecodecamp's projects suggested by Kallaway)

### Day 2: May 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Start the Roll Dice App: set up the dice roll page.
2. re-learn html DOM: with the html DOM, JS can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

**Thoughts** I realized I forgot a lot of what I learned about JS and HTML. But after re-learning them, I feel I have a much better understanding of the materials and they now stick to my mind more rigorously. :)

### Day 3: May 3, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Still working on Roll Dice app:
1. Use javascript instead of HTML to add elements (such as text node, images, input box, and buttons) to the browser.
2. Add onClick attribute to the button
3. Take the value from the input box and pass it into a function.


### Day 4: May 4, Monday
**Today's Progress**:
1. Learn onClick attribute of a HTML element,
2. relationship among event, event listener, and event handler.  
3. when to use onClick and when to use addEventListener(click, function)

### Day 5: May 5, Tuesday
1. Learn event, addEventListener and event handler.
2. Registering the clickHandler by using an extra window addEventListener at load is NOT necessary in the origional code from project 1.

### Day 6: May 6, Wednesday
1. Learn addEventListener takes a NON-parametric handler function only!
2. Add a section to validate input target number to be in [2, 12] and not a NaN.
3. Add a ternary operator to decide between "roll" or "rolls".
4. Add a <hr>
5. Finish the "content" part for the Dice app.
