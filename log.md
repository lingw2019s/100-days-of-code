# 100 Days Of Code - Log
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 1, Friday, 2020].

### Day 0: May 1, Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1. Create local and remote github repos for my 100DaysOfCode challenge.
2. create a basic backdrop for my own portfolio.

**Thoughts:** I'm picking up what I learned in 282 and 382. In the meantime build my own projects (will try freecodecamp's projects suggested by Kallaway)

### Day 2: May 2, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
